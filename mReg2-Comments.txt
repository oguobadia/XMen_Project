I have changed the `Mutant` table only to make it conform to 2NF format... I think.
This will also enable us to meat the requirment for the next sprint that calls for us
to make queries to multiple tables.

-Removed:
	`Power`
	`PowerTwo`
	`PowerOther`
	
	`FstAssoc`
	`ScdAssoc`

-Added:
	Two new tables that will be refrenced by the auto_increment `ID` 
	in the original Mutant table.

	- Powers
		-PID int(3) NOT NULL    --Refrenced to primary key in Mutant table
		-Power varchar(35) NOT NULL   --Power description.  Can be anything now but we can
					      --still keep the given options on the web site

	- Assoc
		-AID int(3) NOT NULL	--Refrenced to primary key in Mutant table
		-Association varchar(35) NOT NULL  	--Associations.  X-Men, The Brotherhood, 
							--etc.  can be anything.
